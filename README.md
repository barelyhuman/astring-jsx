# astring-jsx

> Note: This is a fork of the original project [Qard/astring-jsx](https://github.com/Qard/astring-jsx),I plan to maintain it moving forward as it's a dependent of the [preact-island-plugins](https://github.com/barelyhuman/preact-island-plugins) project

This module wraps [astring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astring) to provide
support for JSX syntax.

# Install

```sh
npm i @barelyhuman/astring-jsx
